# Sketch Removal Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all sketch-based approximate cardinality estimation functionality from the DQX codebase.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Removed Test Files
- Deleted `tests/test_sketches.py` completely
- Removed sketch-related tests from:
  - `tests/test_states.py` (CardinalitySketch tests)
  - `tests/test_specs.py` (ApproxCardinality tests)
  - `tests/test_ops.py` (ApproxCardinality operation tests)
  - `tests/test_provider.py` (approx_cardinality method tests)
  - `tests/test_analyzer.py` (analyze_sketch_ops tests)
  - `tests/e2e/test_api_e2e.py` (end-to-end sketch tests)

### 2. Removed Core Implementation
- Removed from `src/dqx/states.py`:
  - `SketchState` protocol
  - `CardinalitySketch` class
- Removed from `src/dqx/specs.py`:
  - `ApproxCardinality` spec class
  - References from `REGISTRY`
- Removed from `src/dqx/ops.py`:
  - `ApproxCardinality` operation class
- Updated type constraints to remove `SketchOp` references

### 3. Removed API Support
- Removed from `src/dqx/provider.py`:
  - `approx_cardinality()` method from `MetricProvider`
- Removed from `src/dqx/analyzer.py`:
  - `analyze_sketch_ops()` function
  - All sketch-related logic

### 4. Updated Dependencies
- Removed `datasketches` from `pyproject.toml`
- Updated `uv.lock` accordingly

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Removed from `docs/design.md`:
  - Approx. Cardinality row from metrics table
- Updated `docs/dqguard-to-dqx-comparison.md`:
  - Removed "Statistical sketching for memory efficiency" from architecture
  - Changed duplicate detection example to use `duplicate_count` instead
  - Updated architecture description to "Columnar engine" only

## Verification
- All tests pass (628 passing)
- No mypy errors
- No ruff linting issues
- Documentation is consistent

## Breaking Changes
This is a breaking change that removes the `approx_cardinality` method from the public API. Users who were using this functionality will need to either:
1. Use exact `count` for small datasets
2. Implement their own approximate counting solution
3. Use the `duplicate_count` functionality for duplicate detection use cases

## Git History
The implementation was done in the following commits:
1. Initial sketch removal implementation
2. Documentation updates to remove sketch references
