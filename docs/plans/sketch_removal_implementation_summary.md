# Sketch Removal Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-10-17

## Overview
Successfully removed all sketch-related functionality from the DQX codebase as outlined in the plan.

## Changes Made

### Task Group 1: Remove Sketch Tests
- ✅ Removed CardinalitySketch tests from `tests/test_states.py`
- ✅ Removed ApproxCardinality tests from `tests/test_ops.py`
- ✅ Removed ApproxCardinality tests from `tests/test_specs.py`
- ✅ Removed approx_cardinality tests from `tests/test_provider.py` and `tests/test_analyzer.py`
- ✅ Removed sketch_check from `tests/e2e/test_api_e2e.py`

### Task Group 2: Remove Analyzer Support
- ✅ Removed `analyze_sketch_ops` function from `src/dqx/analyzer.py`
- ✅ Removed SketchOp import and sketch-related analysis logic
- ✅ Updated analyzer to only process SQL operations

### Task Group 3: Remove Public API Components
- ✅ Removed `approx_cardinality` method from `src/dqx/provider.py`

### Task Group 4: Remove Core Operations
- ✅ Removed `ApproxCardinality` class from `src/dqx/ops.py`
- ✅ Removed `SketchOp` protocol
- ✅ Updated `OpsType` literal to only include "sql"
- ✅ Updated `T` TypeVar to only bound to `float`

### Task Group 5: Remove State Components and Dependencies
- ✅ Removed `ApproxCardinality` spec from `src/dqx/specs.py`
- ✅ Updated `MetricType` literal to exclude "ApproxCardinality"
- ✅ Removed `CardinalitySketch` class from `src/dqx/states.py`
- ✅ Removed `SketchState` protocol
- ✅ Removed datasketches imports
- ✅ Removed datasketches dependency from `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Updated mypy overrides to exclude datasketches

### Task Group 6: Final Validation
- ✅ All tests pass (628 tests)
- ✅ Mypy type checking passes (no issues in 27 source files)
- ✅ Ruff linting passes (all checks passed)

## Impact
- The codebase is now simpler without sketch-based cardinality estimation
- Removed external dependency on datasketches library
- All approximate cardinality functionality has been removed
- The system now only supports SQL-based operations

## Files Modified
1. `tests/test_states.py`
2. `tests/test_ops.py`
3. `tests/test_specs.py`
4. `tests/test_specs_str.py`
5. `tests/test_provider.py`
6. `tests/test_analyzer.py`
7. `tests/e2e/test_api_e2e.py`
8. `src/dqx/analyzer.py`
9. `src/dqx/provider.py`
10. `src/dqx/ops.py`
11. `src/dqx/specs.py`
12. `src/dqx/states.py`
13. `pyproject.toml`

## Verification
All automated tests pass, type checking is clean, and linting shows no issues. The sketch removal has been completed successfully without breaking any existing functionality.
