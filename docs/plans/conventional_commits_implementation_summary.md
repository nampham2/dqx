# Conventional Commits Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented conventional commit enforcement for the DQX project using commitizen. This ensures all commit messages follow the Conventional Commits specification, enabling automated changelog generation, semantic versioning, and clear commit history.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies Added

Added `commitizen>=3.29.0` to the `dev` dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.

### 2. Configuration Files

#### `.cz.toml` - Single source of truth for commitizen configuration
- All commitizen settings consolidated here (removed duplicate from pyproject.toml)
- Version management settings: version_scheme, version_provider, major_version_zero
- Custom commit types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Project-specific scopes: analyzer, api, graph, evaluator, provider, specs, validator, display, orm, extensions, common, dialect, functions, models, ops, states, utils
- Interactive questions for guided commit creation
- Changelog generation settings
- Version bumping configuration with tag format "v$version"

#### `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Added commitizen hook
- Added commitizen hook for commit-msg validation
- Runs automatically on every commit to ensure compliance

### 3. Script Updates

#### `bin/setup-dev-env.sh`
- Added installation of commit-msg hooks: `uv run pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
- Ensures new developers get commit validation automatically

#### `bin/run-hooks.sh`
- Added `--check-commit` option to validate the last commit message
- Example: `./bin/run-hooks.sh --check-commit`

#### `bin/commit.sh` (new)
- Helper script for creating conventional commits interactively
- Wraps `uv run cz commit` with helpful instructions

### 4. Documentation

#### `README.md`
- Added comprehensive "Conventional Commits" section
- Includes format explanation, types, examples, and helper commands
- Added "Pre-commit Hooks" section explaining all validation

#### `docs/commit_validation_troubleshooting.md` (new)
- Complete troubleshooting guide for commit validation issues
- Common problems and solutions
- Best practices and quick reference
- Examples of proper commit messages

## Usage

### Creating Commits

1. **Interactive Mode** (recommended for beginners):
   ```bash
   ./bin/commit.sh
   # or
   uv run cz commit
   ```

2. **Manual Mode** (for experienced users):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(analyzer): add query optimization"
   git commit -m "fix(evaluator): handle division by zero"
   ```

3. **Breaking Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(api)!: change assertion interface"
   ```

### Validation

- Commits are automatically validated via pre-commit hook
- To check existing commits: `./bin/run-hooks.sh --check-commit`
- To validate a range: `uv run cz check --rev-range origin/main..HEAD`

### Emergency Override

For urgent fixes only:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: fix critical issue"
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Changelog**: Can generate CHANGELOG.md from commits
2. **Semantic Versioning**: Automatically determine version bumps
3. **Clear History**: Structured commit messages improve readability
4. **Team Consistency**: Everyone follows the same format
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Can trigger different workflows based on commit type

## Next Steps

1. Team training on conventional commits
2. Set up changelog generation in CI/CD
3. Configure semantic version bumping
4. Add commit type badges to PR templates

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Commit-msg hook registered
- ✅ Commitizen version 4.9.1 working
- ✅ Helper scripts created and executable
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive and clear

The conventional commit enforcement is now fully operational and ready for use.
