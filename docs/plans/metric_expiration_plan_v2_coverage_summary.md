# Code Coverage Achievement Summary

## Date: October 30, 2025

### Overview
Successfully achieved 100% code coverage for `repositories.py` and `compute.py` by writing targeted tests for previously uncovered lines.

### Files Updated
1. **src/dqx/orm/repositories.py** - Now at 100% coverage
2. **src/dqx/compute.py** - Now at 100% coverage

### New Test Files Created
1. **tests/orm/test_repositories_coverage.py** - 4 tests
   - `test_metadata_type_process_bind_param_with_non_metadata_dict` - Covers line 52
   - `test_ensure_indexes_failure` - Covers lines 118-122
   - `test_get_by_key_with_dataset` - Covers line 208
   - `test_get_metric_window_returns_none` - Edge case coverage

2. **tests/test_compute_coverage.py** - 5 tests
   - `test_day_over_day_with_failing_get_metric_window` - Covers failure path
   - `test_week_over_week_with_failing_get_metric_window` - Covers failure path
   - `test_stddev_with_failing_get_metric_window` - Covers failure path
   - `test_stddev_with_statistics_error` - Covers lines 232-234
   - `test_pass_statements_coverage` - Covers lines 117, 162, 208 (pass statements)

### Coverage Lines Addressed

#### repositories.py:
- Line 52: MetadataType.process_bind_param when value is dict but not Metadata
- Lines 118-122: Exception handling in _ensure_indexes
- Line 208: _get_by_key with dataset parameter filtering

#### compute.py:
- Line 117: Pass statement in day_over_day match case
- Line 162: Pass statement in week_over_week match case
- Line 208: Pass statement in stddev match case
- Lines 232-234: StatisticsError exception handling in stddev

### Test Results
- All 60 tests in the test suite pass
- Both files now have 100% coverage (shown in "16 files skipped due to complete coverage")
- Overall project coverage improved from ~95% to ~96%

### Minor Issues Fixed
- Fixed import sorting issues in api.py and plugins.py
- Added proper return type annotations to all test functions to satisfy mypy

### Verification Commands Used
```bash
# Run specific tests
uv run pytest tests/orm/test_repositories_coverage.py tests/test_compute_coverage.py -xvs

# Check overall coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/dqx --cov-report=term-missing:skip-covered --no-header -q

# Run all repository and compute tests
uv run pytest tests/orm/test_repositories.py tests/orm/test_repositories_coverage.py tests/test_compute.py tests/test_compute_coverage.py -v
```

### Next Steps
Continue with the metric expiration plan implementation as all coverage gaps have been addressed.
