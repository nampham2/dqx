# BigQuery Dialect Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the BigQuery dialect for DQX framework as specified in the plan, with additional enhancements for code reusability and automatic dialect registration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core BigQueryDialect Class
- Created `BigQueryDialect` class in `src/dqx/dialect.py`
- Implemented all required Protocol methods
- Used `@auto_register` decorator for automatic registration

### 2. SQL Translation Implementations
All SqlOp types are correctly translated to BigQuery SQL:
- `NumRows()` → `CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT64)`
- `Average(col)` → `CAST(AVG(col) AS FLOAT64)`
- `Minimum(col)` → `CAST(MIN(col) AS FLOAT64)`
- `Maximum(col)` → `CAST(MAX(col) AS FLOAT64)`
- `Sum(col)` → `CAST(SUM(col) AS FLOAT64)`
- `Variance(col)` → `CAST(VAR_SAMP(col) AS FLOAT64)`
- `First(col)` → `CAST(MIN(col) AS FLOAT64)` (deterministic)
- `NullCount(col)` → `CAST(COUNTIF(col IS NULL) AS FLOAT64)`
- `NegativeCount(col)` → `CAST(COUNTIF(col < 0) AS FLOAT64)`
- `DuplicateCount(cols)` → `CAST(COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT ...) AS FLOAT64)`

### 3. Key BigQuery-Specific Features
- Uses backticks (`) for column aliases instead of single quotes
- Uses `FLOAT64` instead of `DOUBLE` for type casting
- Uses `COUNTIF` instead of `COUNT_IF`
- Uses `VAR_SAMP` instead of `VARIANCE`
- Uses `MIN` instead of `FIRST` for deterministic results

### 4. Batch Query Implementation
- Implemented `build_batch_cte_query()` using STRUCT
- Returns results as `(date: STRING, values: STRUCT<...>)`
- STRUCT approach reduces result set size similar to DuckDB's MAP

### 5. Additional Enhancements

#### Common Batch CTE Logic Refactoring
- Extracted `_build_cte_parts()` for shared CTE construction
- Created `_build_batch_query_with_values()` for query orchestration
- Both dialects now only define their value formatter (MAP vs STRUCT)
- Reduced ~40 lines of duplicated code

#### Automatic Dialect Registration
- Implemented `@auto_register` decorator
- Dialects are automatically registered when the class is defined
- No need for manual `register_dialect()` calls
- Simplifies adding new dialects in the future

### 6. Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_bigquery_dialect.py`
- All 21 tests passing
- Tests cover all SqlOp translations, batch queries, and error cases
- Added integration test for automatic registration

### 7. Documentation
- Updated module docstring with BigQuery examples
- Created `examples/bigquery_dialect_demo.py` demonstrating usage
- Clear documentation of differences between dialects

## Files Modified/Created
1. `src/dqx/dialect.py` - Added BigQueryDialect class and refactored common logic
2. `tests/test_bigquery_dialect.py` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `tests/test_dialect_batch_optimization.py` - Batch optimization tests
4. `examples/bigquery_dialect_demo.py` - Usage demonstration

## Key Design Decisions
1. Used `MIN` instead of BigQuery's `ANY_VALUE` for First operation to ensure deterministic results
2. Chose STRUCT over UNPIVOT for batch queries to minimize result size
3. Implemented automatic registration to simplify dialect management
4. Extracted common batch query logic to avoid code duplication

## Future Considerations
- The refactored utility functions make it easier to add new dialects
- The `@auto_register` pattern can be extended to plugin-based dialect loading
- STRUCT approach in BigQuery provides similar benefits to DuckDB's MAP
