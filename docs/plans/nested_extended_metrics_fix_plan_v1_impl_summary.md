# Nested Extended Metrics Fix Implementation Summary

## Implementation Date
2025-10-29

## Overview
Successfully implemented the fix for nested extended metrics that were failing with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`. The solution involved refactoring the `__hash__` methods in extended metric classes to use the base spec object instead of trying to hash raw parameter dictionaries.

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Implementation (TDD)
- Created `tests/test_specs_nested.py` with comprehensive tests for:
  - Nested DayOverDay metrics
  - Stddev of DayOverDay (the original failing case)
  - Deeply nested metrics (3+ levels)
  - WeekOverWeek of extended metrics
  - Database round-trip persistence

### 2. Core Changes to Extended Metric Classes

#### DayOverDay Class
- Added `_base_spec` storage during initialization
- Updated `__hash__` to use: `hash(("DayOverDay", self._base_spec))`
- Updated `__eq__` to compare base specs directly
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing constructor

#### WeekOverWeek Class
- Applied same pattern as DayOverDay
- Updated `__hash__` to use: `hash(("WeekOverWeek", self._base_spec))`
- Updated `__eq__` to compare base specs directly

#### Stddev Class
- Added `_base_spec` storage during initialization
- Updated `__hash__` to include lag and n parameters: `hash(("Stddev", self._base_spec, self._lag, self._n))`
- Updated `__eq__` to compare base specs and additional parameters

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Stored Base Spec**: Instead of reconstructing the base spec on demand, we now store it during initialization for better performance and consistency.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained the existing constructor signatures and `parameters` property to ensure database serialization continues to work.

3. **Simplified Hashing**: Using the base spec object for hashing automatically handles nested cases since each spec implements proper hashing.

## Test Results
- All 5 new nested metric tests: ✅ PASSED
- All 828 existing tests: ✅ PASSED
- Original failing e2e test: ✅ PASSED
- Type checking (mypy): ✅ PASSED
- Linting (ruff): ✅ PASSED
- Pre-commit hooks: ✅ PASSED

## Deviations from Plan
None. The implementation followed the plan exactly as specified.

## Verification
The fix was verified by:
1. Running the original failing test case which now passes
2. Comprehensive test coverage for various nesting scenarios
3. Full test suite run showing no regressions
4. Database round-trip test confirming serialization still works

## Conclusion
The nested extended metrics fix has been successfully implemented with no regressions or breaking changes. The solution is clean, maintainable, and follows the existing patterns in the codebase.
