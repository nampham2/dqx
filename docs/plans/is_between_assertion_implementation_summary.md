# is_between Assertion Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the `is_between` assertion functionality as specified in the plan, completing all phases and tasks.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Core Function Implementation ✅

#### Task 1: Implement is_between function
- Added `is_between` function to `src/dqx/functions.py`
- Function signature: `is_between(x: float, lower: float, upper: float, tol: float = EPSILON) -> bool`
- Returns True if `lower - tol <= x <= upper + tol`
- Properly handles floating-point tolerance on both bounds

#### Task 2: Write unit tests
- Added comprehensive tests in `tests/test_functions.py`
- Test cases include:
  - Normal range checks (e.g., 15 in [10, 20])
  - Boundary conditions with tolerance
  - Equal bounds (exact value check)
  - Values outside range
  - Edge cases with floating-point precision

#### Task 3: Commit Phase 1 changes
- Committed with message: "feat: Add is_between function with comprehensive tests"
- Commit hash: 4cc8f5bf0ad7eb2714308ab116d06bd9e1d72171

### Phase 2: API Integration ✅

#### Task 4: Add is_between method to AssertionReady
- Added method to `AssertionReady` class in `src/dqx/api.py`
- Method signature: `is_between(self, lower: float, upper: float, tol: float = functions.EPSILON) -> None`
- Includes validation: raises `ValueError` if lower > upper
- Creates `SymbolicValidator` with description "in [lower, upper]"

#### Task 5: Write integration tests
- Updated `test_assertion_ready_has_all_methods` to verify is_between exists
- Added `test_is_between_assertion_workflow` for complete workflow testing
- Added `test_is_between_invalid_bounds` to verify error handling
- All tests passing

#### Task 6: Commit Phase 2 changes
- Committed with message: "feat: Add is_between assertion to API with validation"
- Commit hash: d71d8ebad17f2cf05528157ad0917c3394c2ed33

### Phase 3: Final Validation ✅

#### Task 7: Run quality checks and final commit
- All quality checks passed:
  - mypy: No type errors
  - ruff: All checks passed
  - pytest: All 34 tests passing
  - pre-commit hooks: All passed
- Created demo example in `examples/is_between_demo.py`
- Committed with message: "docs: Add is_between demo example"
- Commit hash: 999fb33fab87ac690162600ed4e37550baf11790

## Key Features Implemented

### Function Behavior
- **Inclusive bounds**: Both lower and upper bounds are inclusive
- **Floating-point tolerance**: Applied symmetrically to both bounds
- **Single value check**: Can use equal bounds to check for exact values

### API Integration
- **Validation**: Prevents invalid ranges where lower > upper
- **Clear representation**: Shows as "in [lower, upper]" in assertion descriptions
- **Consistent interface**: Follows the same pattern as other assertion methods

### Example Usage
```python
# Range check
ctx.assert_that(mp.average("price"))
   .where(name="Average price in valid range")
   .is_between(10.0, 100.0)

# Exact value check (with tolerance)
ctx.assert_that(temperature)
   .where(name="Temperature at optimal 22.5°C")
   .is_between(22.5, 22.5)
```

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for the core function
- Integration tests for API usage
- Error handling tests for invalid inputs
- Demo example showing practical usage

## Documentation Updates
- Updated memory bank progress.md with implementation details
- Updated activeContext.md with current work status
- Created this implementation summary
- Added demo example with comprehensive comments

## Conclusion
The is_between assertion has been successfully implemented according to the plan. All tests are passing, quality checks are clean, and the feature is ready for use. The implementation provides a clean, intuitive API for range-based assertions with proper floating-point tolerance handling.
