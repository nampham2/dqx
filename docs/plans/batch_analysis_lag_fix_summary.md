# Batch Analysis with Lag Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
When using `analyze_batch` with metrics that have lagged dates (e.g., `mp.average("col", key=ctx.key.lag(1))`), duplicate metrics with the same SqlOp but different dates were incorrectly deduplicated, causing only one value to be computed and propagated to all dates.

## Root Cause
The deduplication logic in `analyze_batch` used SqlOp equality to identify equivalent metrics, but SqlOp equality doesn't consider the date context. This caused metrics for different dates to be treated as identical, resulting in value propagation issues.

## Solution
Modified the deduplication logic to be date-aware:

1. **Changed equivalence grouping**: Instead of grouping metrics solely by SqlOp, we now group them by `(date, SqlOp)` pairs.
2. **Maintained efficiency**: The batch SQL query still deduplicates across all dates for generation efficiency.
3. **Correct value assignment**: Each metric gets its correct value based on its specific date.

## Code Changes

### `src/dqx/analyzer.py`

```python
# Before: Grouping by SqlOp only
equivalence_groups = defaultdict(list)
for metric in all_metrics:
    sql_op = metric.produce(ds)
    equivalence_groups[sql_op].append(metric)

# After: Grouping by (date, SqlOp)
equivalence_groups = defaultdict(list)
for date, metrics in metrics_by_date.items():
    for metric in metrics:
        sql_op = metric.produce(ds)
        equivalence_groups[(date.yyyy_mm_dd, sql_op)].append(metric)
```

### `src/dqx/api.py`

Added a check to skip datasets with no metrics to avoid empty batch analysis calls.

## Tests Fixed
1. `test_e2e_with_lag_in_symbol_table` - The original failing test
2. `test_lag_date_handling.py` - All lag-related tests
3. `test_assertion_result_collection.py` - Symbol value collection with lags
4. `test_api_coverage.py` - Added comprehensive coverage tests
5. `test_suite_critical.py` - Fixed empty metric handling

## Verification
- All 746 tests pass
- End-to-end test confirms lagged metrics now compute correctly
- Batch analysis demo shows proper functionality
- No performance regression - batch SQL still efficiently deduplicates

## Key Insight
The fix maintains the efficiency of batch processing while ensuring correctness: the SQL query still deduplicates operations across all dates, but the Python-side value assignment respects date boundaries.
