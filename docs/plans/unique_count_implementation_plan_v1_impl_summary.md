# UniqueCount Implementation - Summary

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented the UniqueCount metric feature following the implementation plan. The implementation is complete and all tests are passing.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Core Operation Implementation
- Created `UniqueCount` class in `ops.py` inheriting from `SqlOp`
- Implemented proper SQL expression generation with `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `test_ops.py`

### 2. Generic NonMergeable State Implementation
- **Decision**: Instead of creating a separate `UniqueCount` state class, leveraged the existing `NonMergeable` state class
- Modified `NonMergeable` to accept a `metric_type` parameter for better identification
- Updated `DuplicateCount` spec to use `NonMergeable` state with `metric_type="DuplicateCount"`
- This approach reduces code duplication and maintains consistency

### 3. Spec and Provider Implementation
- Added `UniqueCount` spec class in `specs.py` using `NonMergeable` state
- Added `unique_count()` method to `MetricProvider` in `provider.py`
- Updated the registry to include UniqueCount
- All implementations follow existing patterns

### 4. SQL Dialect Implementation
- Added dialect support for both DuckDB and BigQuery
- Properly handles column name quoting and escaping
- Added comprehensive dialect tests

### 5. API Integration Tests
- Created thorough API-level tests covering:
  - Basic functionality
  - Null handling (COUNT(DISTINCT) excludes nulls)
  - Edge cases (empty data, all nulls, all same value)
  - Different data types
  - Symbol metadata verification

## Deviations from Original Plan

### NonMergeable State Approach
The most significant deviation was the decision to use the existing `NonMergeable` state class instead of creating a new `UniqueCount` state class. This decision was made because:
1. UniqueCount and DuplicateCount both produce non-mergeable results
2. The existing `NonMergeable` class already had all required functionality
3. Adding a `metric_type` parameter allowed for proper identification
4. This approach reduces code duplication and maintenance burden

### Test Structure
Updated test structure to accommodate the NonMergeable state approach:
- Modified `DuplicateCount` tests to expect `NonMergeable` state instead of `DuplicateCount` state
- Added proper `metric_type` assertions in tests

## Testing Results

All tests passing:
- Unit tests for ops, states, specs, dialect, and provider
- API integration tests
- Total: 243 tests passed
- Type checking: No mypy errors
- Linting: All ruff checks passed
- Pre-commit hooks: All passed

## Code Quality

- Followed all project conventions
- Added comprehensive docstrings
- Proper type hints throughout
- No backward compatibility issues (as instructed)
- Consistent with existing patterns

## Conclusion

The UniqueCount feature is fully implemented and ready for use. The implementation leverages existing infrastructure where possible, maintains consistency with the codebase, and provides a clean API for users.

Example usage:
```python
# Through MetricProvider
mp.unique_count("customer_id")

# Direct spec usage
specs.UniqueCount("customer_id")
```

The feature correctly handles null values (excludes them from counting) and works with all supported data types.
