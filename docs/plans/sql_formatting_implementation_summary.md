# SQL Formatting Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented SQL formatting in the DQX analyzer using sqlparse library. The implementation ensures that all SQL queries generated by the analyzer are properly formatted for improved readability while maintaining compatibility with all SQL dialects.

## Completed Tasks

### Task Group 1: Add sqlparse dependency ✅
- Added sqlparse 0.5.1 to pyproject.toml dependencies
- Added mypy type stubs configuration
- Installed and verified the dependency

### Task Group 2: Simplify build_cte_query ✅
- Removed manual alignment logic from `build_cte_query` function
- Simplified the function to produce plain unformatted SQL
- Updated all tests that were expecting aligned format

### Task Group 3: Add formatting to analyzer ✅
- Added `format_sql` utility function to analyzer.py
- Integrated formatting in `analyze_sql_ops` method
- Configured sqlparse with appropriate formatting options:
  - `reindent=True` for proper indentation
  - `keyword_case="upper"` for uppercase SQL keywords
  - `identifier_case="lower"` for lowercase identifiers
  - `strip_comments=False` to preserve comments

### Task Group 4: Update remaining tests ✅
- Updated dialect tests to expect lowercase SQL keywords
- All 654 tests pass successfully
- No regression in functionality

### Task Group 5: Final validation ✅
- All pre-commit hooks pass
- Created demo script showing SQL formatting in action
- Verified formatted output with various metrics

## Key Changes

### File: `pyproject.toml`
- Added `sqlparse = "^0.5.1"` to dependencies
- Added mypy configuration for sqlparse type stubs

### File: `src/dqx/dialect.py`
- Removed manual alignment logic from `build_cte_query`
- Simplified SELECT statement construction

### File: `src/dqx/analyzer.py`
- Added `format_sql` function using sqlparse
- Modified `analyze_sql_ops` to format SQL before logging

### File: `tests/test_dialect.py`
- Updated test expectations for lowercase SQL keywords

### File: `examples/sql_formatting_demo.py`
- Created comprehensive demo showing formatted SQL output

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: SQL queries are now properly formatted with consistent indentation and keyword casing
2. **Maintainability**: Removed complex manual alignment logic in favor of a well-tested library
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust formatting options if needed
4. **Compatibility**: Works with all supported SQL dialects (DuckDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Example Output

Before:
```sql
WITH SOURCE AS (SELECT * FROM orders) SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS DOUBLE) AS _abc_num_rows(), CAST(AVG(price) AS DOUBLE) AS _def_average(price)
```

After:
```sql
WITH SOURCE AS
  (SELECT *
   FROM orders)
SELECT cast(count(*) AS DOUBLE) AS _abc_num_rows(),
       cast(avg(price) AS DOUBLE) AS _def_average(price)
FROM SOURCE
```

## Testing

- All existing tests pass (654 tests)
- Pre-commit hooks validate code quality
- Demo script verifies formatting functionality

## Future Considerations

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for SQL formatting. Future enhancements could include:
- Configurable formatting options via environment variables
- Different formatting styles for different use cases
- Performance optimization for very large SQL queries (though current performance is excellent)

## Conclusion

The SQL formatting implementation successfully achieves the goal of improving SQL readability in DQX while maintaining full compatibility with existing functionality. The use of sqlparse provides a robust and maintainable solution that can be easily extended in the future.
