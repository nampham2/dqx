# Remove Batch Support Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all batch processing support from DQX to simplify the analyzer for the first release. The implementation focused on removing `BatchSqlDataSource` protocol, `ArrowBatchDataSource` implementation, and all threading/batch processing infrastructure.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Protocol & Interface Cleanup (Complete)
- ✅ Removed `BatchSqlDataSource` protocol from `common.py`
- ✅ Updated module docstring to remove batch processing references

### Phase 2: Analyzer Implementation (Complete)
- ✅ Removed batch processing imports:
  - `from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor`
  - `from functools import partial`
- ✅ Removed batch processing methods:
  - `_analyze_batches()`
  - `_analyze_batches_threaded()`
- ✅ Simplified `analyze()` method to directly call `analyze_single()`
- ✅ Added validation in `analyze()` to reject unsupported data sources
- ✅ Fixed error handling to properly check data source attributes

### Phase 3: Extension & Test Cleanup (Complete)
- ✅ Removed `ArrowBatchDataSource` class entirely from `pyarrow_ds.py`
- ✅ Removed all batch-related tests:
  - `test_analyze_batch_sequential`
  - `test_analyze_batch_threaded`
  - `test_analyze_batch_accumulation`
  - `test_arrow_batch_datasource_init`
  - `test_arrow_batch_datasource_arrow_ds`
  - `test_arrow_batch_datasource_from_parquets`
  - `test_arrow_batch_datasource_with_record_batches`
- ✅ Removed the test for rejecting batch datasources (no longer needed)

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup (Complete)
- ✅ Updated `design.md`:
  - Removed references to TB-scale batch processing
  - Removed threading parameters
  - Updated architecture section to remove batch processing mentions
  - Simplified API examples
- ✅ Updated `README.md`:
  - Removed threading parameter from example code
- ✅ Removed all batch processing references from code

### Phase 5: Verification & Validation (Complete)
- ✅ All 571 tests passing
- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passing (mypy, ruff, etc.)
- ✅ No remaining batch processing code in the codebase

## Key Decisions

1. **Retained `merge()` functionality**: Even though batch processing was removed, the merge capability is still useful for combining analysis reports from different time periods or manual accumulation scenarios.

2. **Kept internal batching in `analyze_sketch_ops`**: The `batch_size` parameter in `analyze_sketch_ops` is for memory-efficient processing of Arrow data and is not related to the removed batch processing feature.

3. **Simplified error messages**: Updated error handling to provide clear messages when unsupported data sources are used.

## Verification

Final verification shows:
- No references to `BatchSqlDataSource` or `ArrowBatchDataSource` in source code
- No batch processing methods (`_analyze_batches`, `_analyze_batches_threaded`)
- No threading infrastructure for batch processing
- All tests pass
- Code quality checks pass

## Impact

The removal of batch processing significantly simplifies the codebase:
- Reduced complexity in the analyzer
- Clearer single-pass processing model
- Easier to understand and maintain
- No threading-related issues to debug

The analyzer now focuses on efficient single-pass analysis using DuckDB's query engine, which is sufficient for most use cases while keeping the architecture simple.
