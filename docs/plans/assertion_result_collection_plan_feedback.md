# Architectural Feedback: Assertion Result Collection Plan

## Executive Summary

The assertion result collection plan demonstrates excellent understanding of the DQX codebase and proposes a well-designed solution that integrates naturally with existing patterns. The plan is **ready for implementation** with minor enhancements for error serialization and exception safety.

## Strengths of the Plan

### 1. Correct Understanding of the Architecture
The plan accurately identifies and utilizes key DQX components:
- Graph hierarchy (RootNode → CheckNode → AssertionNode)
- The `Result` type from the `returns` library
- The `_value` attribute in AssertionNode storing evaluation results
- The Context and VerificationSuite relationship

### 2. Appropriate Design Decisions
- **AssertionResult dataclass**: Simple, focused data container with all necessary fields
- **is_evaluated flag**: Prevents premature result collection
- **Reusing existing traversal**: Correctly leverages `self._context._graph.assertions()`
- **Placement in common.py**: Appropriate location for the dataclass

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Strategy
The test suite properly covers:
- Error cases (calling before run)
- Success and failure scenarios
- Edge cases (unnamed assertions, empty suites)
- Integration with real data sources

## Key Architectural Validations

### No Dataset Field Needed
- Correct: Only SymbolicMetrics are associated with datasets, not assertions
- The plan correctly omits dataset information from AssertionResult

### Simple Traversal Approach
- Using `assertions()` method is the right choice
- No need for visitor pattern - keeps implementation simple and maintainable

### No Over-Engineering
- No filtering at collection time - users can filter results post-collection
- No metadata field - follows YAGNI principle
- Validation and result collection don't interfere

## Implementation Enhancements

### 1. JSON Serialization for Error Messages
Serialize complete failure information as JSON:

```python
import json

# In collect_results method:
error_msg = None
if not assertion._value.is_ok():
    failures = assertion._value.failure()
    if failures:
        # Serialize all failure information
        error_data = [
            {
                "error_message": f.error_message,
                "expression": f.expression,
                "symbols": [
                    {
                        "name": s.name,
                        "metric": s.metric,
                        "dataset": s.dataset,
                        "value": str(s.value)
                    }
                    for s in f.symbols
                ]
            }
            for f in failures
        ]
        error_msg = json.dumps(error_data)
```

### 2. Exception Safety for is_evaluated Flag
Use try/finally to ensure flag is set even on partial failures:

```python
def run(self, datasources: dict[str, SqlDataSource], key: ResultKey, threading: bool = False) -> None:
    """Execute the verification suite..."""
    try:
        # ... existing run logic ...

        # 3. Evaluate assertions
        evaluator = Evaluator(self.provider, key)
        self._context._graph.bfs(evaluator)
    finally:
        # Ensure flag is set even if evaluation partially fails
        self.is_evaluated = True
```

## Design Principles Followed

1. **Simplicity**: Solution is straightforward and easy to understand
2. **Reusability**: Leverages existing graph traversal methods
3. **Type Safety**: Proper use of type hints and dataclasses
4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: AssertionResult is a pure data container
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage planned

## Future Considerations (Not Needed Now)

While not required for the initial implementation, these could be considered later:
- Generator-based lazy evaluation for very large suites
- Result caching for repeated calls
- Filtering options at collection time

## Conclusion

The assertion result collection plan is well-architected and ready for implementation. It:
- Fits naturally into the existing DQX architecture
- Maintains consistency with codebase patterns
- Provides clear value to users
- Avoids unnecessary complexity

The only recommended changes are:
1. JSON serialization of error messages for complete failure information
2. Try/finally block for exception safety

With these minor enhancements, this feature will be a valuable addition to the DQX framework.
