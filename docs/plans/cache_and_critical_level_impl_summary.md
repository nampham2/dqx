# Cache and Critical Level Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented caching functionality and `is_critical()` method for VerificationSuite as specified in the plan.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Caching Infrastructure (Task Group 2)
- Added `_results_cache` and `_symbols_cache` attributes to VerificationSuite
- Modified `collect_results()` and `collect_symbols()` to return cached values when available
- Cache is automatically cleared when `run()` is called
- Both methods now share the same object reference on repeated calls

### 2. is_critical Method (Task Group 3)
- Implemented `is_critical()` method that checks for P0 failures
- Uses cached results for efficient checking
- Returns True if any assertion with severity="P0" has failed
- Raises ValueError if called before suite has been run

### 3. Testing
- Created comprehensive test files:
  - `tests/test_suite_caching.py`: Tests caching behavior
  - `tests/test_suite_critical.py`: Tests is_critical functionality
- All 10 tests pass successfully

### 4. Example
- Created `examples/suite_cache_and_critical_demo.py` demonstrating:
  - Caching performance benefits
  - is_critical() usage with different severity levels
  - Real-world alert system scenario

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Simple caching strategy**: Direct attribute storage instead of complex cache mechanisms
2. **Automatic cache invalidation**: Cache cleared on each run() call
3. **Same object references**: Cached results return the exact same objects
4. **P0-specific detection**: is_critical() only considers P0 failures as per requirements

## Validation
- All tests pass (10/10)
- Mypy type checking passes
- Ruff linting passes
- Example runs successfully (except for unrelated NaN handling issue)

## Files Modified
- `src/dqx/api.py`: Added caching and is_critical implementation
- `tests/test_suite_caching.py`: New test file for caching
- `tests/test_suite_critical.py`: New test file for is_critical
- `examples/suite_cache_and_critical_demo.py`: New comprehensive example

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for use. The caching provides immediate performance benefits for repeated calls, and the is_critical() method enables easy P0 failure detection for alerting systems.
