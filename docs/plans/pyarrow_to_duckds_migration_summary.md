# PyArrow DataSource to DuckDS Migration Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Completed by**: Claude

## Overview

Successfully migrated from the obsolete `pyarrow_ds.py` implementation to the new `duckds.py` implementation throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Obsolete File
- Deleted `src/dqx/extensions/pyarrow_ds.py` (the ArrowDataSource implementation)

### 2. Updated Imports
Replaced all imports from:
```python
from dqx.extensions.pyarrow_ds import ArrowDataSource
```

To:
```python
from dqx.extensions.duckds import DuckRelationDataSource
```

### 3. Updated DataSource Instantiation
Changed all ArrowDataSource instantiations from:
```python
ds = ArrowDataSource(table)
```

To:
```python
ds = DuckRelationDataSource.from_arrow(table)
```

### 4. Files Modified
The following test files were updated:
- `tests/extensions/test_duck_ds.py`
- `tests/test_api.py`
- `tests/test_lag_date_handling.py`
- `tests/test_evaluator_validation.py`
- `tests/test_duplicate_count_integration.py`
- `tests/test_assertion_result_collection.py`
- `tests/test_symbol_ordering.py`
- `tests/e2e/test_api_e2e.py`
- `tests/test_analyzer.py`
- `tests/test_suite_caching.py`
- `tests/test_api_coverage.py`
- `tests/test_dialect.py`
- `tests/test_suite_critical.py`

### 5. Test Results
All tests pass after the migration:
- `test_duck_ds.py`: 4 tests passed
- `test_analyzer.py`: 29 tests passed
- No linting or type checking errors

## Key Differences

1. **Instantiation**: The new DuckRelationDataSource uses a factory method `from_arrow()` instead of direct constructor
2. **Implementation**: Uses DuckDB's relation API for better performance and integration
3. **Compatibility**: Maintains the same interface (SqlDataSource protocol) for seamless migration

## Notes

- The migration was straightforward due to both implementations following the same SqlDataSource protocol
- No changes were required to the business logic, only the import statements and instantiation patterns
- All existing functionality is preserved
