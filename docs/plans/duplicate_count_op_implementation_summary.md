# DuplicateCount Op Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Task Group 1 (tasks 1-4) of the duplicate_count_op_implementation_plan_v2.md.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Write tests for DuplicateCount Op
- Added comprehensive tests in `tests/test_ops.py`
- Tests cover:
  - Basic functionality with single and multiple columns
  - Column sorting behavior
  - String representation
  - SQL properties (name, prefix, sql_col)
  - Equality and hashing
  - Clear functionality
  - Integration with dedup_ops function

### Task 2: Implement DuplicateCount Op
- Added `DuplicateCount` class to `src/dqx/ops.py`
- Features:
  - Accepts list of columns to check for duplicates
  - Automatically sorts columns for consistent behavior
  - Implements all required SqlOp abstract methods
  - Proper string representation: `duplicate_count(col1, col2, ...)`
  - Consistent hashing based on sorted columns

### Task 3: Write tests for Dialect Translation
- Added tests in `tests/test_dialect.py`
- Tests cover:
  - Translation to SQL for single column
  - Translation to SQL for multiple columns
  - Actual execution against DuckDB to verify correctness
  - Column order independence

### Task 4: Implement Dialect Translation
- Added DuplicateCount case to `DuckDBDialect` in `src/dqx/dialect.py`
- SQL pattern: `CAST(COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT ...) AS DOUBLE)`
- Handles single column without parentheses
- Handles multiple columns with parentheses: `(col1, col2, ...)`

## Quality Metrics
- All tests passing (81 tests in total for ops and dialect modules)
- 100% code coverage for both modified modules
- Type checking passed (mypy) - Fixed fetchone() type handling
- Linting passed (ruff)
- Follows project coding standards and patterns

## Next Steps
The remaining tasks from the plan (Tasks 5-13) involve:
- Creating DuplicateCount spec
- Integrating with provider and state management
- Adding to public API
- Creating comprehensive examples
- Testing with evaluator and data sources
