# Metric Key Dataset Fix - Implementation Summary

## Date: 2024-10-28

## Issue Summary
When multiple metrics with the same key (metric_type, parameters, date, tags, dataset) exist in the database from different execution runs, the ORM methods `get_metric_value()` and `get_metric_window()` were returning arbitrary values instead of the latest ones.

## Root Cause
The SQL queries in these methods were missing `ORDER BY created DESC` clauses, causing the database to return metrics in arbitrary order when multiple matches existed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `_get_by_key()` method
- Added `ORDER BY created DESC` to ensure the latest metric is returned
- Already had `LIMIT 1` in place

### 2. Fixed `get_metric_value()` method
- Added `ORDER BY created DESC` before `LIMIT 1`
- Ensures the latest metric value is returned for a given key

### 3. Fixed `get_metric_window()` method
- Implemented Option B: Used window functions with ROW_NUMBER()
- Created a CTE that partitions by date and orders by created timestamp descending
- Selects only the latest metric for each date (row_number = 1)
- Maintains the expected behavior of returning one value per date

### 4. Added microsecond timestamps in `persist()` method
- Ensures each metric in a batch has a unique timestamp
- Adds microsecond offsets to guarantee ordering stability
- Prevents timestamp collisions in rapid insertions

## Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test `test_multiple_execution_metric_retrieval` that:
  - Runs the same suite multiple times with different data
  - Verifies that latest values are always returned
  - Tests both `get_metric_value()` and `get_metric_window()` methods
  - Validates metric trace functionality
  - Ensures proper execution_id tracking

## Files Modified
1. `src/dqx/orm/repositories.py`
   - Updated `_get_by_key()`, `get_metric_value()`, `get_metric_window()`, and `persist()` methods

2. `tests/e2e/test_multiple_execution_retrieval.py`
   - New comprehensive test for multiple execution scenarios

3. `tests/orm/test_repositories.py`
   - Fixed mock test to use `execute()` instead of `scalars()`

## Verification
- All 857 tests pass
- No regressions introduced
- Multiple execution scenarios now work correctly
