# Plan Review

Review an implementation plan as an architect and provide feedback.

## Step 1: Locate the Plan
Use git commands to locate the plan in docs/plans/. Plans are typically recent markdown files in the current branch.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>Which plan should I review?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 2: Analyze the Implementation Plan
Read the plan thoroughly. Review the memory bank, codebase, and documentation. Use sequential thinking tools as needed. Ask clarifying questions.

## Step 3: Iterate on Feedback
Present your feedback and confirm its accuracy.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>Is the feedback accurate and complete?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 4: Document the Review
Confirm the review file location. Reviews use the plan filename with "_review" suffix. If a review already exists, confirm before overwriting.

Write the feedback to the confirmed location.
