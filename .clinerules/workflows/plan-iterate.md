# Plan Iteration

Incorporate architectural review feedback into a new plan version.

## Step 1: Locate Review Feedback
Use git commands to find the latest review document. Reviews are markdown files in the same folder as plans, with "_review" suffix. The filename includes the version number.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>Which review should I read?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 2: Analyze the Review
Read the review carefully and compare it with the corresponding plan. Use sequential thinking tools as needed. Ask clarifying questions.

## Step 3: Address Feedback
Present your approach to address the feedback in 200-300 word sections, confirming accuracy after each section. Iterate until the feedback is addressed.

## Step 4: Create Updated Plan
Confirm the location for the new plan version. Suggest options: next version number or alternative approaches.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>What version should the updated plan use?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

Write the plan to the agreed location with the correct version.
