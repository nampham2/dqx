# Plan iterate

## Step 1. Gather the feedback location
The feedback document should be in markdown format placed under the same folder as the plan with `_review` suffix.
The feedback for a specific version contains the version in the filename.
Please try your best effort to with the git commands to find the right feedback version (usually the latest one) to read.

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the name of the review I have to read?</question>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Step 2. Read the review
Please read the review carefully and compare with the corresponding plan. Use sequential thinking tool if needed.
Ask me clarification questions if you have any.

## Step 3. Plan to address the feedback and iterate
Once you believe you understand what we're doing, stop and describe the plan to address the feedback,
in sections of maybe 200-300 words at a time, asking after each section whether it looks right so far.

Keep iterating until I am satisfied with the feedback.

## Step 4. Write the feedback plan.
First, confirm with me the location of new version of plan.
Come up with a few options: next latest plan version, others ...

<ask_followup_question>
<question>What version of the plan you want to write?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

Then write the plan to the aggreed location with the correct version.
