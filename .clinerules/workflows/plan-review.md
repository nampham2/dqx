# Plan review

## Step 1. Gather the plan location
We have the plan written under `docs/plans`, you need to know the name of the plan for reviewing.
The plan is usually in a markdown file that is recently modified in the current branch.
Please try your best effort to with the git commands to guess the plan markdown file.

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the name of the plan I have to review?</question>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Step 2. Read and review the implementation plan.
Now you know the implementation plan, please read it carefully.
Also read the memory bank, code base, and documentations. Use sequential thinking tool if needed.
Ask me clarification questions if you have any.

NOTE: Please do not write the plan to a file in this step yet.

## Step 3. Write the feedback plan.
Finally, confirm with the user the location of the review file.
The review file naming convention is the plan file name with the `_review_` suffix.
If the review already exists, please ask user if it is ok to overwrite.
