# Idea brainstorming
I've got an idea I want to talk through with you. I'd like you to help me turn it into a fully formed design and spec (and eventually an implementation plan)

## Step 1. Check out the project and gather background information
Checkout the memory bank and the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting off.
Then ask me questions, one at a time, to help refine the idea.
Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK, too. Don't forget: only one question per message.

## Step 2. Brainstorming topic
Ask me what is the brainstorming topic and follow up with as many clarification questions as possible.
If this topic involve code chang, YOU MUST ASK if we need backward compabilility in whatever we are brainstorming.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the topic for brainstorming?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 3. Brainstorming session
Think about the topic clearly, ask questions until you completely understand the topic.
Once you believe you understand what we're doing, stop and describe the design to me,
in sections of maybe 200-300 words at a time, asking after each section whether it looks right so far.
