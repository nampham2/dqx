# Plan Implementation

Implement tasks from a plan documented in markdown.

## Step 1: Locate the Plan
Use git commands to locate the plan in docs/plans/. Plans are typically recent markdown files in the current branch.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the name of the plan to implement?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 2: Understand the Implementation Plan
Read the plan carefully. Review the memory bank, codebase, and documentation. Use sequential thinking tools as needed. Ask clarifying questions.

## Step 3: Determine Implementation Scope
Check the codebase for already-implemented tasks and existing implementation summaries. Read these first, then identify remaining work.

<ask_followup_question>
<question>Which tasks should I implement?</question>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 4: Execute Implementation
Implement the specified tasks. Ask questions when unclear. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN.
