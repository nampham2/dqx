We have a concrete plan written in a markdown documentation. You need to implement the tasks described in the plan documentation.

# Plan implementation

## Step 1. Gather the plan location
We have the plan written under `docs/plans`, you need to know the name of the plan for reviewing.
The plan is usually in a markdown file that is recently modified in the current branch.
Please try your best effort to with the git commands to guess the plan markdown file.

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the name of the plan I have to implement?</question>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Step 2. Read and understand the implementation plan.
Now you know the implementation plan, please read it carefully.
Also read the memory bank, code base, and documentations. Use sequential thinking tool if needed.

Ask me clarification questions if needed.

## Step 3. Gather what to implement.
Great. I need your help to write out a comprehensive implementation plan.

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Do you need me to implement all the tasks or only a subset of it?</question>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Step 4. Do the implementation
Now you know what to implement, please go ahead. If you have questions, please stop and ask me. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN.
