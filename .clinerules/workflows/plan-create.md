We have come up with a good implementation plan in mind, now we need to write the concrete plan.

# Write out an implementation plan - Detailed sequence of steps.

## Step 1. Gather version information

Get the version information

<ask_followup_question>
<question>So you like to write out the detailed plan. Do you have a specific version of the plan in mind?
I can create a new version of the plan or modify the current <current version> version.</question>
<options>[Modify the current version <current version>, Create a new version <new version> of the plan]</options>
</ask_followup_question>

## Step 2. Write a plan to docs/plans with version gathered in step 1.

Great. I need your help to write out a comprehensive implementation plan.

Assume that the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. document everything they need to know. which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check. how to test it.give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. frequent commits.
Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. assume they don't know good test design very well.

Please write out this plan, in full detail, into docs/plans/ with the version gathered in Step 1.
