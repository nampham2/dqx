# Workflow Tools - Productivity & Memory

## Issue Tracking

- You MUST use your TodoWrite tool to keep track of what you're doing
- You MUST NEVER discard tasks from your TodoWrite todo list without Nam's explicit approval

## Learning and Memory Management

- YOU MUST use the journal tool frequently to capture technical insights, failed approaches, and user preferences
- Before starting complex tasks, search the journal for relevant past experiences and lessons learned
- Document architectural decisions and their outcomes for future reference
- Track patterns in user feedback to improve collaboration over time
- When you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in your journal rather than fixing it immediately
