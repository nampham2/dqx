# Elements of Style - Key Principles Summary

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity and Precision
- Use definite, specific, concrete language
- Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague
- Make every word tell

### 2. Conciseness
- Omit needless words
- A sentence should contain no unnecessary words
- A paragraph should contain no unnecessary sentences
- Vigorous writing is concise

### 3. Active Voice
- Use the active voice - it's more direct and vigorous
- "I shall always remember my first visit to Boston" (not "My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me")

### 4. Positive Form
- Put statements in positive form
- Make definite assertions
- Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating language
- Use "dishonest" not "not honest", "forgot" not "did not remember"

### 5. Parallel Construction
- Express coordinate ideas in similar form
- Use consistent grammatical structures for related elements
- Maintain consistency in lists and series

### 6. Emphasis Through Position
- Place emphatic words at the end of sentences
- The end of a sentence is the position of prominence
- Begin with the subject when possible

## Key Rules Applied to Technical Writing

### 1. Paragraph Unity
- One paragraph per topic
- Begin with a topic sentence
- End in conformity with the beginning
- Make the paragraph the unit of composition

### 2. Related Words Together
- Keep the subject and verb close
- Place modifiers next to words they modify
- Avoid ambiguous pronoun references

### 3. Consistency
- Maintain one tense in summaries
- Use consistent terminology
- Follow established patterns

### 4. Common Improvements
- Replace "the fact that" with simpler constructions
- Avoid "there is/are" constructions when possible
- Use strong verbs instead of weak verb + noun combinations
- Eliminate redundant expressions like "he is a man who"

## Application to Code Documentation

### 1. Comments and Docstrings
- State what the code does, not how
- Be specific about inputs, outputs, and side effects
- Avoid redundant comments that repeat the code

### 2. Variable and Function Names
- Use precise, descriptive names
- Avoid vague terms like "data", "info", "temp"
- Names should tell what code does, not how it's implemented

### 3. Error Messages
- Be specific about what failed
- Provide actionable information
- Follow the pattern: "[What failed]: [Why]. [What user can do]."

### 4. Technical Explanations
- Start with the most important information
- Build from simple to complex
- Use concrete examples
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
