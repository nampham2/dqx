# Progress

## What Works

### Core Features
- Basic metric collection (average, sum, min, max, variance, etc.)
- Null and negative value counting
- Duplicate detection across single or multiple columns
- **NEW: CountValues operation for counting specific values**
- Analyzer with SQL generation
- Multiple SQL dialect support (DuckDB, BigQuery)
- Batch analysis with optimized queries
- Result caching and persistence
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Comprehensive test coverage

### API Features
- Fluent API for building data quality checks
- Method chaining for intuitive usage
- Clear error messages and validation
- Type safety with full mypy compliance

### Recent Additions (2024-10-24)
- **CountValues Operation**: Count occurrences of specific values in columns
  - Single value counting: `api.count_values("status", "active")`
  - Multiple value counting: `api.count_values("category", ["A", "B", "C"])`
  - Support for both string and integer values
  - Proper SQL escaping for security
  - Full integration with existing dialect system

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
- Additional statistical operations (percentiles, standard deviation)
- Pattern matching operations (regex support)
- Date/time specific validations
- Cross-column validations and correlations

### Medium Priority
- Performance optimizations for very large datasets
- Streaming support for real-time data
- More SQL dialect support (PostgreSQL, Snowflake)
- Advanced reporting and visualization

### Low Priority
- GUI for building checks
- Integration with popular data orchestration tools
- Machine learning based anomaly detection

## Current Status

The project is production-ready for core data quality validation tasks. The recent addition of CountValues extends the capability to handle categorical data validation more effectively.

## Known Issues

- None currently reported for CountValues implementation
- Batch queries can be memory intensive for very large result sets
- Some edge cases in date handling for batch analysis (being addressed)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### CountValues Implementation (2024-10-24)
- Decided to support both single values and lists for flexibility
- Chose homogeneous type enforcement to prevent confusion
- Implemented proper SQL escaping from the start
- Used MD5 hashing for unique SQL column names
- Separated int/str handling in constructor for type safety

### Previous Decisions
- Moved from simple validation to comprehensive metric collection
- Adopted plugin architecture for extensibility
- Implemented dialect system for multi-database support
- Added batch analysis for performance optimization
- Introduced caching for improved performance
