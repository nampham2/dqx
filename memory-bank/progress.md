# Progress

## What Works
- Core DQX framework for data quality checks
- Metric computation and assertion system
- Extended metrics (week_over_week, day_over_day, stddev, etc.)
- Dataset validation and imputation
- Recursive dataset imputation for child dependencies (NEW)
- Graph traversal using visitor pattern
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Batch analysis and optimization
- Multiple SQL dialect support (DuckDB, BigQuery, etc.)
- Rich logging and display capabilities
- Suite caching and critical check levels
- Symbol collection and validation

## Recent Fixes
- Fixed recursive dataset imputation in DatasetImputationVisitor (2025-01-24)
  - Child metrics created by extended metrics now properly inherit datasets
  - Ensures metrics like lag(7) created by week_over_week get correct dataset assignment
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for extended metric scenarios

## What's Left to Build
- Performance monitoring for large metric graphs with recursive processing
- Additional extended metric types and their tests
- Further optimization of batch SQL queries
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging tools

## Current Status
- All tests passing (including new recursive imputation tests)
- Pre-commit hooks passing
- Code committed with conventional commit message
- Ready for next feature or bug fix

## Known Issues
- None currently identified with the recursive imputation implementation

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted visitor pattern for graph traversal operations
- Implemented recursive processing to handle nested metric dependencies
- Maintained backward compatibility while adding new functionality
- Focused on comprehensive integration testing for complex scenarios
