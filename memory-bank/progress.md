# Progress

## What Works
- Core DQX framework for data quality checks
- Metric computation and assertion system
- Extended metrics (week_over_week, day_over_day, stddev, etc.)
- Dataset validation and imputation
- Recursive dataset imputation for child dependencies
- Graph traversal using visitor pattern
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Batch analysis and optimization
- Multiple SQL dialect support (DuckDB, BigQuery, etc.)
- Rich logging and display capabilities
- Suite caching and critical check levels
- Symbol collection and validation
- Correct date handling for lag metrics in symbol table (NEW)

## Recent Fixes
- Fixed recursive dataset imputation in DatasetImputationVisitor (2025-01-24)
  - Child metrics created by extended metrics now properly inherit datasets
  - Ensures metrics like lag(7) created by week_over_week get correct dataset assignment
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for extended metric scenarios

- Fixed lag metric date handling in symbol collection (2025-01-24)
  - Lag metrics now correctly show their effective date (nominal date - lag days)
  - Fixed _create_lag_dependency in provider.py to pass correct date to lag dependencies
  - Symbol table now accurately reflects when each metric's data is from
  - Added tests to verify lag metrics have correct yyyy_mm_dd values

## What's Left to Build
- Performance monitoring for large metric graphs with recursive processing
- Additional extended metric types and their tests
- Further optimization of batch SQL queries
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging tools

## Current Status
- All tests passing (including new lag date tests)
- Pre-commit hooks passing
- Code ready for commit
- Ready for next feature or bug fix

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted visitor pattern for graph traversal operations
- Implemented recursive processing to handle nested metric dependencies
- Maintained backward compatibility while adding new functionality
- Focused on comprehensive integration testing for complex scenarios
- Ensured accurate date tracking for time-series metrics
