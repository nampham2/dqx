# DQX Project Progress

## Current Status

The DQX (Data Quality eXtensions) library is a comprehensive data quality validation framework built on Apache Arrow and DuckDB. It provides a fluent API for defining data quality checks, metrics calculation, and validation rules.

## Recently Completed Work

### 2025-10-26: Symbol Deduplication and Lag Refactoring
- **What**: Implemented symbol deduplication for batch analysis and refactored lag handling throughout the codebase
- **Why**:
  - Symbol deduplication reduces redundant SQL operations in batch analysis, improving performance
  - The old ResultKeyProvider API was complex and error-prone; the new lag parameter API is simpler
- **Changes**:
  - Created `SymbolDeduplicationVisitor` to collect unique operations across multiple dates
  - Integrated deduplication into `Analyzer._analyze_batch_sql_ops()`
  - Removed `ResultKeyProvider` from the public API
  - Changed all metric methods to use `lag: int = 0` parameter instead of `key` parameter
  - Updated `compute` module functions to accept `nominal_key: ResultKey` instead of provider
  - Updated extended metrics to compute lag internally based on nominal key
  - Created automated test update script to migrate all tests to new API
- **Impact**:
  - This is a breaking change - all code using `key=` parameter must be updated to use `lag=`
  - Performance improvement: Batch analysis now deduplicates operations across dates
  - Simpler API: Users no longer need to understand ResultKeyProvider

### 2025-01-26: Added print_metrics_by_execution_id Display Function
- **What**: Created a new display function to format and print metrics retrieved by execution ID
- **Why**: Users needed a convenient way to display metrics from `data.metrics_by_execution_id()` in a readable format
- **Changes**:
  - Added `print_metrics_by_execution_id()` function to `display.py`
  - Takes list of Metric objects and execution ID as parameters
  - Displays formatted Rich table with Date, Metric Name, Type, Dataset, Value, and Tags columns
  - Sorts metrics by date (newest first) then alphabetically by name
  - Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_display_metrics_by_execution_id.py`
  - Added example demo in `examples/metrics_by_execution_id_demo.py`
- **Impact**: Provides consistent display formatting for execution-specific metrics

### 2025-01-25: Removed suite field from SymbolInfo
- **What**: Removed the `suite` field from the `SymbolInfo` dataclass as it was redundant
- **Why**: The suite information is available at the context level where symbols are collected, making it unnecessary to store in each symbol
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `suite: str` field from `SymbolInfo` in `common.py`
  - Updated `collect_symbols()` method signature to remove `suite_name` parameter
  - Updated evaluator to stop populating the suite field
  - Removed "Suite" column from symbol display tables
  - Updated all tests and examples to work without the suite field
- **Impact**: This is a breaking change for any code that relies on the `suite` field in `SymbolInfo`

### Previous Work
- Implemented extended metrics system with dependency resolution
- Added BigQuery dialect support for SQL generation
- Created batch analysis optimization for large datasets
- Implemented plugin system with audit capabilities
- Added symbol collection and display features
- Created comprehensive test coverage (100%)

## Key Features Working

### Core Functionality
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive set of metrics (sum, average, min, max, count, etc.)
- **Assertions**: Flexible assertion API with chaining support
- **Datasets**: Support for multiple data sources via Apache Arrow
- **Validation**: Rule-based data quality validation
- **SQL Generation**: Optimized SQL generation with dialect support (DuckDB, BigQuery)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of large datasets with deduplication
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom post-processing

### Advanced Features
- **Extended Metrics**: Custom metrics with dependency resolution
- **Symbol Collection**: Track and analyze metric computations
- **Symbol Deduplication**: Optimize batch analysis by removing redundant operations
- **Result Persistence**: Store validation results in database
- **Critical Level Detection**: Identify P0 failures automatically
- **Rich Display**: Beautiful console output for results
  - `print_assertion_results()`: Display assertion validation results
  - `print_symbols()`: Display symbol computation values
  - `print_metrics_by_execution_id()`: Display metrics for a specific execution

## Current Architecture

### Core Components
1. **API Layer** (`api.py`): High-level interfaces (Context, MetricProvider, VerificationSuite)
2. **Provider Layer** (`provider.py`): Metric computation and symbol management
3. **Evaluator** (`evaluator.py`): Expression evaluation engine
4. **Dialect System** (`dialect.py`): SQL generation for different databases
5. **Plugin System** (`plugins.py`): Extensible post-processing
6. **Graph Visitors** (`graph/visitors/`): Traversal algorithms including symbol deduplication

### Data Flow
1. User defines checks using the fluent API
2. Metrics are computed via SQL or in-memory operations
3. Batch analysis applies symbol deduplication for efficiency
4. Assertions are evaluated using the expression engine
5. Results are collected and can be persisted
6. Plugins process results for reporting/alerting

## Known Issues

None currently identified.

## Next Potential Improvements

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Further optimize batch processing for very large datasets
   - Add query result caching
   - Explore parallel execution of independent metric computations

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Add more built-in metrics (percentiles, stddev, etc.)
   - Support for streaming data validation
   - Add data profiling capabilities

3. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Add more database dialects (PostgreSQL, Snowflake)
   - Create integrations with popular data orchestration tools
   - Add webhook support for alerts

## Technical Decisions

### Why Symbol Deduplication?
- Batch analysis was generating redundant SQL operations for the same metric across dates
- Deduplication reduces SQL query complexity and improves performance
- The visitor pattern allows clean separation of concerns

### Why Remove ResultKeyProvider?
- The API was complex and required users to understand key creation and lag operations
- The new `lag` parameter is intuitive and aligns with user mental models
- Simplifies the codebase by removing an abstraction layer

### Why Remove suite from SymbolInfo?
- The suite information is contextual and available where symbols are collected
- Reduces redundancy in the data model
- Simplifies the API by removing unnecessary parameters
- Makes SymbolInfo focused solely on metric computation details

### Design Philosophy
- **Fluent API**: Intuitive, chainable interface for defining checks
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system allows custom functionality
- **Performance**: Optimized SQL generation and batch processing
- **Testability**: 100% test coverage with comprehensive examples
