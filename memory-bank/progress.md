# DQX Project Progress

## Current Status

The DQX (Data Quality eXtensions) library is a comprehensive data quality validation framework built on Apache Arrow and DuckDB. It provides a fluent API for defining data quality checks, metrics calculation, and validation rules.

## Recently Completed Work

### 2025-01-25: Removed suite field from SymbolInfo
- **What**: Removed the `suite` field from the `SymbolInfo` dataclass as it was redundant
- **Why**: The suite information is available at the context level where symbols are collected, making it unnecessary to store in each symbol
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `suite: str` field from `SymbolInfo` in `common.py`
  - Updated `collect_symbols()` method signature to remove `suite_name` parameter
  - Updated evaluator to stop populating the suite field
  - Removed "Suite" column from symbol display tables
  - Updated all tests and examples to work without the suite field
- **Impact**: This is a breaking change for any code that relies on the `suite` field in `SymbolInfo`

### Previous Work
- Implemented extended metrics system with dependency resolution
- Added BigQuery dialect support for SQL generation
- Created batch analysis optimization for large datasets
- Implemented plugin system with audit capabilities
- Added symbol collection and display features
- Created comprehensive test coverage (100%)

## Key Features Working

### Core Functionality
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive set of metrics (sum, average, min, max, count, etc.)
- **Assertions**: Flexible assertion API with chaining support
- **Datasets**: Support for multiple data sources via Apache Arrow
- **Validation**: Rule-based data quality validation
- **SQL Generation**: Optimized SQL generation with dialect support (DuckDB, BigQuery)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of large datasets
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom post-processing

### Advanced Features
- **Extended Metrics**: Custom metrics with dependency resolution
- **Symbol Collection**: Track and analyze metric computations
- **Result Persistence**: Store validation results in database
- **Critical Level Detection**: Identify P0 failures automatically
- **Rich Display**: Beautiful console output for results

## Current Architecture

### Core Components
1. **API Layer** (`api.py`): High-level interfaces (Context, MetricProvider, VerificationSuite)
2. **Provider Layer** (`provider.py`): Metric computation and symbol management
3. **Evaluator** (`evaluator.py`): Expression evaluation engine
4. **Dialect System** (`dialect.py`): SQL generation for different databases
5. **Plugin System** (`plugins.py`): Extensible post-processing

### Data Flow
1. User defines checks using the fluent API
2. Metrics are computed via SQL or in-memory operations
3. Assertions are evaluated using the expression engine
4. Results are collected and can be persisted
5. Plugins process results for reporting/alerting

## Known Issues

None currently identified.

## Next Potential Improvements

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Further optimize batch processing for very large datasets
   - Add query result caching

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Add more built-in metrics (percentiles, stddev, etc.)
   - Support for streaming data validation
   - Add data profiling capabilities

3. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Add more database dialects (PostgreSQL, Snowflake)
   - Create integrations with popular data orchestration tools
   - Add webhook support for alerts

## Technical Decisions

### Why Remove suite from SymbolInfo?
- The suite information is contextual and available where symbols are collected
- Reduces redundancy in the data model
- Simplifies the API by removing unnecessary parameters
- Makes SymbolInfo focused solely on metric computation details

### Design Philosophy
- **Fluent API**: Intuitive, chainable interface for defining checks
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system allows custom functionality
- **Performance**: Optimized SQL generation and batch processing
- **Testability**: 100% test coverage with comprehensive examples
