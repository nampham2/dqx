## Evolution of Project Decisions

### v0.5.0 - Further Simplification
**Decision**: Remove VerificationSuiteBuilder
**Rationale**: The builder pattern added unnecessary complexity without providing significant benefits over direct instantiation
**Result**: Cleaner, more straightforward API that's easier to understand and maintain

### v0.4.0 - Simplification Phase
**Decision**: Remove assertion chaining
**Rationale**: Chaining created confusion about when assertions were evaluated
**Result**: Cleaner, more predictable API

**Decision**: Remove listener pattern
**Rationale**: Added complexity without clear benefit
**Result**: Simpler architecture, easier to understand

**Decision**: Immutable nodes
**Rationale**: Prevent state mutations, improve thread safety
**Result**: More reliable, easier to debug

**Decision**: Mandatory assertion naming
**Rationale**: Improve debugging by requiring descriptive names for all assertions
**Result**: Two-stage pattern (AssertionDraft â†’ AssertionReady) ensures every assertion has a clear purpose

### v0.3.0 - Architecture Refinement
**Decision**: Move symbol tracking to AssertionNode
**Rationale**: Better separation of concerns
**Result**: CheckNode simplified to pure aggregation

**Decision**: Enhance observer pattern
**Rationale**: Direct symbol state tracking
**Result**: Clearer error propagation

### v0.2.0 - Dialect Unification
**Decision**: Remove .sql property, require dialects
**Rationale**: Eliminate SQL generation duplication
**Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable code

### v0.1.0 - Foundation
**Decision**: Graph-based architecture
**Rationale**: Enable dependency tracking and optimization
**Result**: Efficient execution, clear relationships

**Decision**: SymPy for expressions
**Rationale**: Natural mathematical syntax
**Result**: Intuitive API for complex assertions
