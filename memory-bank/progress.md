# Progress

## What Works
- Core DQX functionality (data quality checks, assertions, metrics)
- Plugin system with audit plugin showing execution summaries
- Pre-commit hooks integrated with the project
- BigQuery dialect support
- Batch SQL optimization for performance
- Dataset validation with clear error messages
- Comprehensive test coverage (100%)
- **New Python-based hooks command (`uv run hooks`) replacing shell script**

## What's Left to Build
- Additional plugin types beyond audit
- More database dialect support
- Enhanced documentation
- Performance optimizations for very large datasets

## Current Status
- Project is stable and production-ready
- Active development on new features
- Regular maintenance and bug fixes

## Known Issues
- None currently reported

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### 2025-01-27: Replaced Shell Script with Python Command
- Replaced `bin/run-hooks.sh` with `uv run hooks` command
- Implementation in `scripts/commands.py` provides better cross-platform support
- All functionality preserved with improved argument parsing
- Updated all documentation references to use new command

### Recent Major Changes
- Added data discrepancy display to AuditPlugin
- Implemented count values operation
- Removed Mock usage from test files
- Enhanced plugin execution context with trace analysis

### Architecture Decisions
- Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- Separation of concerns between analysis, evaluation, and reporting
- Use of PyArrow for efficient data handling
- Batch SQL optimization for improved performance
