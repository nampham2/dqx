# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is in a stable state with the VerificationSuite graph improvements fully implemented. The e2e test file shows the API is working smoothly with direct instantiation pattern and the graph property access patterns.

## Recently Completed Work (October 14, 2025)

### Graph Property Implementation
Implemented defensive graph property with explicit tracking:
- Added `_graph_built` flag to track when graph has been constructed
- Graph property raises `DQXError` if accessed before `build_graph()` or `run()`
- Property provides read-only access to the internal `Graph` instance
- Clear error message guides users to call `build_graph()` or `run()` first

### Renamed collect() to build_graph()
- Renamed `collect()` method to `build_graph()` for better clarity
- Updated all internal references and test files
- Method now sets `_graph_built = True` after successful validation
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Removed validate() Method
- Removed standalone `validate()` method from VerificationSuite
- Validation now happens automatically during `build_graph()`
- Updated all tests to use `build_graph()` instead of `validate()`
- Updated documentation to reflect this change
- Errors raise `DQXError`, warnings are logged but don't fail

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `dataset_validation_guide.md` to remove `validate()` references
- Updated best practices to recommend `build_graph()` for early validation
- Clarified that validation happens automatically during graph building

## Current API Usage Patterns (from e2e test)

### Check Decorator Pattern
```python
@check(name="Simple Checks", datasets=["ds1"])
def simple_checks(mp: MetricProvider, ctx: Context) -> None:
    ctx.assert_that(mp.null_count("delivered")).where(
        name="Delivered null count is less than 100"
    ).is_leq(100)
```

### Direct Suite Instantiation
```python
suite = VerificationSuite(checks, db, name="Simple test suite")
suite.run({"ds1": ds1, "ds2": ds2}, key)
suite.graph.print_tree()  # Safe access after run()
```

### Result Collection Methods
- `suite.collect_results()` - Collect assertion results
- `suite.collect_symbols()` - Collect symbol information
- Both methods work after graph is built

## Key Technical Decisions

### Graph Access Pattern
- Graph is only accessible after it's been built
- Prevents access to incomplete or invalid graph states
- Clear error messages guide proper usage
- E2e test demonstrates correct usage pattern

### Validation Integration
- Validation is no longer a separate step
- Happens automatically during graph building
- Simplifies the API and ensures validation always occurs

### API Simplification History
- v0.5.0: Removed VerificationSuiteBuilder
- v0.4.0: Removed assertion chaining, made assertions require names
- Current: Defensive graph access, integrated validation

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any issues with the new implementation
- Consider additional graph visualization features
- Potential improvements to error messages and debugging tools
- Explore streaming data support (planned for Q1 2025)

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Assertion Naming
All assertions must have descriptive names using the two-stage pattern:
```python
ctx.assert_that(metric).where(name="Description").is_gt(0)
```

### Cross-Dataset Validation
Supported through dataset parameter:
```python
mp.average("tax", dataset="ds1")
mp.average("tax", dataset="ds2")
```

### Time-Series Comparisons
Using key.lag() for historical comparisons:
```python
mp.average("tax", key=ctx.key.lag(1))
```

### Extension Methods
Custom metrics available through mp.ext:
```python
mp.ext.day_over_day(specs.Average("tax"))
```

## Current State
All tests passing, documentation updated, and implementation complete. The VerificationSuite now has a cleaner API with:
- Defensive graph property access
- Renamed `build_graph()` method (from `collect()`)
- Integrated validation (no separate `validate()`)
- Direct instantiation (no builder pattern)
- Mandatory assertion names
- Clear separation of concerns
