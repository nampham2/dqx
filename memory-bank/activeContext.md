# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Successfully implemented recursive dataset imputation for child dependencies in DatasetImputationVisitor
- Fixed issue where extended metrics (like week_over_week) create child metrics (like lag) that weren't getting proper dataset assignment
- Added comprehensive integration tests to verify the recursive processing works correctly

## Recent Changes (2025-01-24)
- Modified `DatasetImputationVisitor` in `src/dqx/graph/visitors.py`:
  - Added recursive processing of child nodes in the visitor
  - Each visited node now also visits all its children recursively
  - Ensures that nested dependencies (like lag metrics created by extended metrics) inherit datasets from their parents
- Created new test file `tests/test_extended_metric_recursive_imputation.py`:
  - Tests week_over_week and day_over_day extended metrics
  - Tests stddev which creates multiple lag dependencies
  - Tests circular dependency handling (defensive test)
  - Verifies that all child metrics get proper dataset assignment

## Key Implementation Details
- The recursive processing happens in the `visit` method of `DatasetImputationVisitor`
- After processing a node, it iterates through all children and visits them recursively
- This ensures that even deeply nested metric dependencies get proper dataset imputation

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any performance implications of recursive processing in large metric graphs
- Consider adding more extended metric types to the test coverage
- The implementation is complete and all tests are passing

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Extended metrics create child dependencies that must be processed
- Dataset imputation must flow from parent to child metrics
- Recursive processing ensures all nodes in the dependency graph are visited
- The visitor pattern allows for clean separation of graph traversal logic

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Extended metrics in DQX create implicit child metrics (e.g., week_over_week creates lag(7))
- These child metrics need proper dataset assignment for the evaluation to work correctly
- The visitor pattern makes it easy to add recursive processing without major architectural changes
- Integration tests are crucial for catching issues with complex metric dependencies
