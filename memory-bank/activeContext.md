### Recently Completed: Parent-Child Relationship Reversal

Successfully reversed the parent-child relationship for extended metrics in DQX:

**Key Changes:**
1. **ExtendedMetricProvider** - Extended metrics (day_over_day, week_over_week, stddev) are now parents of their base metrics and lag dependencies
2. **DatasetImputationVisitor** - Updated to propagate datasets from parent metrics to their children
3. **DatasetValidator** - Now validates that child metrics have consistent datasets with their parents
4. **UnusedSymbolValidator** - Updated to understand the new relationship when determining unused symbols

**Implementation Details:**
- Base metrics are registered as children of extended metrics
- Lag dependencies are registered as children of extended metrics
- Dataset propagation flows from parent (extended metric) to children (base metrics, lag metrics)
- All tests updated to reflect the new relationship
- Documentation and examples updated

**Files Modified:**
- `src/dqx/provider.py` - Reversed parent-child registration in ExtendedMetricProvider
- `src/dqx/graph/visitors.py` - Updated DatasetImputationVisitor logic
- `src/dqx/validator.py` - Updated DatasetValidator and UnusedSymbolValidator
- Various test files to match new expectations
- `examples/parent_child_dataset_validation_demo.py` - Updated documentation

### Active Work Focus

The parent-child relationship reversal is complete and all tests pass. The system now correctly models extended metrics as parents of their dependencies.

### Important Patterns

1. **Parent-Child Hierarchy**: Extended metrics → Base metrics → Dependencies
2. **Dataset Propagation**: Flows from parent to child during imputation
3. **Validation**: Ensures consistency between parent and child datasets
4. **Symbol Collection**: Correctly identifies unused symbols considering the hierarchy

### Next Steps

- Monitor for any edge cases with the new parent-child relationship
- Consider additional extended metric types that might need similar treatment
- Ensure documentation clearly explains the parent-child model

### Recent Insights

The reversal of parent-child relationships makes the model more intuitive - extended metrics that depend on base metrics are naturally parents in the hierarchy. This aligns better with how users think about metric dependencies.
