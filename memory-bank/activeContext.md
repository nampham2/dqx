# Active Context - DQX

## Current Focus
- Completed implementation of Metric Expiration Plan v2
- All rollback tasks and improvements successfully implemented
- Code quality verified with all tests passing, mypy, and ruff checks

## Recent Changes

### Metric Expiration Implementation (2024-10-30)
1. **Metadata.ttl_hours**: Rolled back to required field with default 168 hours
2. **Timezone Handling**: Replaced datetime.utcnow() with datetime.now(timezone.utc)
3. **Database Optimization**: Removed get_all() antipattern
4. **Stats Simplification**: Removed unnecessary fields (non_expiring_metrics, total_expired_bytes)
5. **Performance**: Optimized delete_expired_metrics to use single DELETE query
6. **Type Safety**: Fixed type annotations in tests (MetricProvider, Context)
7. **Pattern Matching**: Updated code to use match statements for Result types where possible

### Code Quality Improvements
- Consistent use of timezone-aware datetime objects
- Better type hints throughout the codebase
- Simplified API surface for metric expiration
- Atomic database operations for better concurrency

## Next Steps
- Monitor metric expiration performance in production
- Consider adding metrics/logging for expiration operations
- Potential future work: batch expiration notifications

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Database Operations
- Always use timezone-aware datetime (datetime.now(timezone.utc))
- Prefer single atomic queries over multiple operations
- Use SQLAlchemy's func for database functions

### Type Safety
- Always provide proper type hints for function parameters
- Use MetricProvider and Context types in test functions
- Pattern matching preferred over isinstance checks where mypy allows

### Testing
- Comprehensive edge case testing for time-based operations
- Mock time-sensitive operations for deterministic tests
- Verify both success and failure paths

## Recent Learnings

### SQLAlchemy JSON Operations
- Use func.json_extract() for accessing JSON fields in WHERE clauses
- Cast JSON values to appropriate types: .cast(Integer)
- SQLite's julianday() useful for date arithmetic

### Pattern Matching Limitations
- Mypy has limitations with Maybe type pattern matching
- Fallback to isinstance(maybe, Some) when needed
- Result types work well with match statements

### Performance Considerations
- Single DELETE query significantly faster than SELECT + DELETE
- Database indexes crucial for expiration queries
- Consider batch size limits for large-scale operations
