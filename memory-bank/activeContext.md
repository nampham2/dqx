# Active Context

## Current Focus
Successfully completed the VerificationSuite graph improvements implementation based on the architect's plan (verification_suite_graph_improvements_plan_v2.md).

## Recently Completed Work (October 14, 2025)

### Graph Property Implementation
Implemented defensive graph property with explicit tracking:
- Added `_graph_built` flag to track when graph has been constructed
- Graph property raises `DQXError` if accessed before `build_graph()` or `run()`
- Property provides read-only access to the internal `Graph` instance
- Clear error message guides users to call `build_graph()` or `run()` first

### Renamed collect() to build_graph()
- Renamed `collect()` method to `build_graph()` for better clarity
- Updated all internal references and test files
- Method now sets `_graph_built = True` after successful validation
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Removed validate() Method
- Removed standalone `validate()` method from VerificationSuite
- Validation now happens automatically during `build_graph()`
- Updated all tests to use `build_graph()` instead of `validate()`
- Updated documentation to reflect this change
- Errors raise `DQXError`, warnings are logged but don't fail

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `dataset_validation_guide.md` to remove `validate()` references
- Updated best practices to recommend `build_graph()` for early validation
- Clarified that validation happens automatically during graph building

## Key Technical Decisions

### Graph Access Pattern
- Graph is only accessible after it's been built
- Prevents access to incomplete or invalid graph states
- Clear error messages guide proper usage

### Validation Integration
- Validation is no longer a separate step
- Happens automatically during graph building
- Simplifies the API and ensures validation always occurs

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any issues with the new implementation
- Consider additional graph visualization features
- Potential improvements to error messages and debugging tools

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Defensive programming with explicit state tracking
- Clear error messages that guide users to correct usage
- Integration of validation into the natural workflow
- Removal of redundant API methods for cleaner interface

## Current State
All tests passing, documentation updated, and implementation complete. The VerificationSuite now has a cleaner API with:
- Defensive graph property access
- Renamed `build_graph()` method
- Integrated validation
- No separate `validate()` method
