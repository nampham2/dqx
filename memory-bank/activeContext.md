# Active Context - DQX

## Current Focus
- Completed refactoring of metric expiration logic with helper method
- Integrated metric cleanup stats into VerificationSuite and plugin system
- All tests passing with improved code organization and type safety

## Recent Changes

### Metric Expiration Refactoring (2025-10-30)
1. **Helper Method**: Created `_build_expiration_filter()` to eliminate duplicated SQL filter logic
2. **MetricStats Dataclass**: New frozen dataclass for metric statistics
3. **API Simplification**: Renamed `get_expired_metrics_stats` to `get_metrics_stats`
4. **Integration**: Added metric cleanup to VerificationSuite before analysis
5. **Plugin Context**: Made `metrics_stats` mandatory in PluginExecutionContext
6. **Audit Plugin**: Enhanced to display metric cleanup information
7. **Caching**: Added `_metrics_stats` property to VerificationSuite to avoid duplicate DB calls

### Previous Implementation (2024-10-30)
- Metadata.ttl_hours as required field with default 168 hours
- Timezone-aware datetime handling throughout
- Optimized DELETE query for expired metrics
- Removed antipatterns and improved type safety

### Code Quality Improvements
- Consistent use of timezone-aware datetime objects
- Better type hints throughout the codebase
- Simplified API surface for metric expiration
- Atomic database operations for better concurrency

## Next Steps
- Monitor the automatic metric cleanup in VerificationSuite runs
- Consider exposing metric cleanup stats in API responses
- Potential optimization: batch cleanup operations by TTL groups

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Database Operations
- Always use timezone-aware datetime (datetime.now(timezone.utc))
- Prefer single atomic queries over multiple operations
- Use SQLAlchemy's func for database functions
- Extract common SQL conditions into helper methods to avoid duplication
- Use frozen dataclasses for read-only data structures

### Type Safety
- Always provide proper type hints for function parameters
- Use MetricProvider and Context types in test functions
- Pattern matching preferred over isinstance checks where mypy allows

### Testing
- Comprehensive edge case testing for time-based operations
- Mock time-sensitive operations for deterministic tests
- Verify both success and failure paths

## Recent Learnings

### SQLAlchemy JSON Operations
- Use func.json_extract() for accessing JSON fields in WHERE clauses
- Cast JSON values to appropriate types: .cast(Integer)
- SQLite's julianday() useful for date arithmetic

### Pattern Matching Limitations
- Mypy has limitations with Maybe type pattern matching
- Fallback to isinstance(maybe, Some) when needed
- Result types work well with match statements

### Performance Considerations
- Single DELETE query significantly faster than SELECT + DELETE
- Database indexes crucial for expiration queries
- Consider batch size limits for large-scale operations
- Cache computed values (like metrics_stats) to avoid repeated DB queries
- Cleanup operations integrated into analysis workflow for efficiency

### Plugin System Integration
- PluginExecutionContext now carries metrics_stats for audit trail
- Automatic metric cleanup happens before suite analysis
- Plugin authors can access cleanup statistics via context.metrics_stats
- Audit plugin provides visibility into cleanup operations
