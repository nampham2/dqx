# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Successfully fixed lag metric date handling in symbol collection
- Lag metrics now correctly show their effective date (nominal date - lag days) in the symbol table
- This ensures accurate tracking of when each metric's data is actually from

## Recent Changes (2025-01-24)
### Earlier Today:
- Modified `DatasetImputationVisitor` in `src/dqx/graph/visitors.py`:
  - Added recursive processing of child nodes in the visitor
  - Each visited node now also visits all its children recursively
  - Ensures that nested dependencies (like lag metrics created by extended metrics) inherit datasets from their parents

### Just Completed:
- Modified `_create_lag_dependency` in `src/dqx/provider.py`:
  - Changed to pass the lagged ResultKey (with adjusted date) instead of the original key
  - This ensures lag metrics show their actual effective date in symbol collection
  - The fix was a simple one-line change that has significant impact on date accuracy

- Created new test file `tests/test_extended_metric_symbol_info_fix.py`:
  - Tests that lag metrics show correct yyyy_mm_dd values in symbol table
  - Verifies lag(7) metrics show date 7 days before nominal date
  - Tests nested lag metrics and various lag values (1, 2, 3, 7 days)

## Key Implementation Details
- The fix ensures that when a lag metric is created, it receives the correct effective date
- This is crucial for understanding time-series data and debugging metric computations
- The symbol table now accurately reflects the temporal nature of lag metrics

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any side effects of the date handling change
- Consider if other extended metrics need similar date adjustments
- The implementation is complete and tests are passing

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Extended metrics create child dependencies that must be processed correctly
- Dataset imputation must flow from parent to child metrics
- Date accuracy is crucial for time-series metrics
- Small changes can have significant impacts on system behavior

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Extended metrics in DQX create implicit child metrics with temporal offsets
- The ResultKey's date should reflect the actual data being used, not just the nominal date
- Symbol collection is an important debugging tool that needs accurate metadata
- Integration tests help catch subtle issues with date handling
