## Current Work Focus: Parent-Child Dataset Validation

### Recent Implementation (2024-10-24)
Successfully enhanced dataset validation to check parent-child symbol relationships, ensuring dataset consistency across hierarchical metric dependencies.

### Key Implementation Details

#### Enhanced DatasetValidator
- Extended validation to check child symbols of metrics used in assertions
- Added recursive validation for parent-child dataset consistency
- Validates that child symbols either:
  - Have the same dataset as their parent
  - Have no dataset (will be imputed from parent)
  - Are not using a conflicting dataset

#### Enhanced DatasetImputationVisitor
- Added parent-child dataset propagation during imputation
- When a parent symbol has a dataset, propagates it to children with no dataset
- Validates that children don't have conflicting datasets
- Maintains consistency across the entire symbol dependency tree

#### Error Reporting
- Clear error messages for parent-child dataset mismatches
- Reports specific symbol names and dataset conflicts
- Example: "Child symbol 'day_over_day(revenue)' has dataset 'staging' but parent 'sum(revenue)' uses 'production'"

### Test Coverage
- Comprehensive tests for parent-child validation scenarios
- Tests for dataset propagation from parent to child
- Tests for multiple children with different datasets
- Tests for allowing children without datasets (imputation)

### Usage Impact
This prevents subtle bugs where:
- A parent metric uses production data
- Its derived metric (e.g., day_over_day) accidentally uses staging data
- Results would be incorrect due to dataset mismatch

### Next Steps
- Monitor for edge cases in complex symbol hierarchies
- Consider validation for more complex dependency chains
- Potentially add visualization of dataset propagation

### Important Patterns Learned
1. Dataset consistency must be enforced across symbol dependencies
2. Parent-child relationships in metrics need special validation
3. Clear error messages are crucial for debugging dataset issues
4. Recursive validation is necessary for deep hierarchies

### Previous Work: CountValues Op Implementation
Successfully implemented the CountValues operation for DQX, allowing users to count occurrences of specific values in columns. Key features:
- Support for single values and lists
- Type safety with mypy compliance
- SQL injection prevention
- Integration with Provider API
