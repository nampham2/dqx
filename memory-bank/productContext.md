# DQX Product Context

## Why DQX Exists

### The Problem Space
Modern data pipelines face critical challenges in ensuring data quality at scale:

1. **Scale Challenge**: Traditional data validation tools struggle with large-scale datasets
2. **Performance Bottleneck**: Full dataset scans are prohibitively expensive
3. **Complex Dependencies**: Data quality checks often have interdependent metrics
4. **Limited Expressiveness**: Existing tools lack flexible mathematical assertions
5. **Historical Blindness**: No easy way to track metric evolution over time

### Market Context
Organizations increasingly rely on data for critical decisions, making data quality a board-level concern. Existing solutions either:
- Sacrifice performance for completeness (full scans)
- Sacrifice accuracy for speed (sampling)
- Require extensive custom code for complex validations

DQX bridges this gap by providing both performance AND accuracy through innovative architecture.

## How DQX Solves These Problems

### 1. **Graph-Based Architecture**
- Automatically deduplicates metric computations
- Enables efficient execution planning
- Provides clear dependency visualization
- Supports complex validation scenarios

### 2. **Statistical Sketching**
- HyperLogLog for cardinality (99.9% accuracy, <1% memory)
- DataSketches for quantiles and distributions
- Enables large-scale processing with MB-scale memory

### 3. **Symbolic Expression System**
- Natural mathematical syntax for assertions
- Compose complex rules from simple metrics
- Type-safe expression evaluation
- Automatic null handling

### 4. **Declarative API Design**
```python
# Instead of procedural validation...
if avg_price is None or avg_price <= 0:
    raise ValidationError("Invalid average price")

# DQX provides declarative syntax
ctx.assert_that(mp.average("price")).is_gt(0)
```

## User Experience Goals

### For Data Engineers
1. **Write Once, Run Anywhere**: Same checks work on different data sources
2. **Minimal Boilerplate**: Focus on validation logic, not infrastructure
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Know exactly what failed and why
4. **Integration Ready**: Works with existing pipelines (Airflow, dbt, etc.)

### For Analytics Teams
1. **Business-Friendly API**: Express rules in natural language
2. **No SQL Required**: Use Python for all validations
3. **Visual Feedback**: See validation results clearly
4. **Historical Context**: Track metric trends over time

### For Platform Teams
1. **Production Ready**: Built-in error handling and monitoring
2. **Extensible**: Add custom metrics and data sources
3. **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
4. **Scalable**: Handles growth without architecture changes

## Core User Workflows

### 1. **Quick Validation** (5 minutes)
```python
# Define check
@check
def validate_orders(mp, ctx):
    ctx.assert_that(mp.null_count("order_id")).is_eq(0)
    ctx.assert_that(mp.average("amount")).is_gt(0)


# Run validation
suite = VerificationSuite([validate_orders], db, "Quick Check")
suite.run({"orders": data}, key)
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Monitoring** (30 minutes)
- Define multiple checks with severity levels
- Set up cross-dataset validations
- Configure historical comparisons
- Integrate with alerting systems

### 3. **Custom Extension** (2 hours)
- Implement custom metric types
- Add new data source adapters
- Create domain-specific validators
- Build reusable check libraries

## Product Principles

### 1. **Performance First**
Every design decision prioritizes sub-second response times on large datasets.

### 2. **Developer Joy**
The API should feel natural and intuitive, with helpful error messages and clear documentation.

### 3. **Production Ready**
No surprises in production - comprehensive testing, error handling, and monitoring built-in.

### 4. **Extensible by Design**
Users should be able to extend DQX without modifying core code.

### 5. **Mathematical Rigor**
Leverage proven algorithms and mathematical foundations for reliability.
