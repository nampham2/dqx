class Graph:
    """Graph structure for data quality verification.

    The Graph class provides traversal and management functionality for a hierarchical
    structure of data quality checks and assertions. It implements various traversal
    algorithms (BFS and DFS) in both synchronous and asynchronous modes, and supports
    the visitor pattern for flexible node processing.

    The graph follows a three-level hierarchy:
        - RootNode: Top-level container for the entire verification suite
        - CheckNode: Groups related assertions under a common check
        - AssertionNode: Leaf nodes containing actual validation logic

    This class serves as the primary interface for:
        - Traversing the node hierarchy using different algorithms
        - Propagating dataset information through the graph
        - Collecting specific types of nodes for processing
        - Supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations

    Attributes:
        root: The RootNode instance that serves as the entry point to the graph.
            All traversal operations start from this node.

    Examples:
        >>> from dqx.graph.nodes import RootNode, CheckNode, AssertionNode
        >>> from dqx.graph.visitors import NodePrinter
        >>>
        >>> # Create a graph structure
        >>> root = RootNode("quality_suite")
        >>> graph = Graph(root)
        >>>
        >>> # Add checks and assertions
        >>> check = CheckNode("completeness_check")
        >>> root.add_child(check)
        >>>
        >>> # Traverse the graph
        >>> visitor = NodePrinter()
        >>> graph.dfs(visitor)
        >>>
        >>> # Propagate datasets
        >>> graph.impute_datasets(['production_db', 'staging_db'])
        >>>
        >>> # Collect all assertions
        >>> assertions = graph.assertions()
